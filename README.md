# Kotlin-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen Kotlin coding assessment that requires the candidate to write a method that returns the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The class to write this method in is `src/main/kotlin/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculator.kt`.

The test cases that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in `src/test/kotlin/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorTest.kt`.

The test cases that are run and are hidden to the candidate are located in `src/test/kotlin/dev/codescreen/FibonacciCalculatorHiddenTest.kt`.
